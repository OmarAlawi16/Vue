## 🎯 What I Learned

This project helped me practice Vue's core functionalities, including:

- ✔ **Template syntax** ({{ }} expressions)
- ✔ **Loops & lists** using v-for
- ✔ **Conditional rendering** with v-if
- ✔ **State management** with **Pinia**
- ✔ **Components** & props/emits
- ✔ **Forms** with v-model
- ✔ **Computed properties**

### ❌ Features Not Implemented

- ❌ Vue Router (no page navigation)
- ❌ List transitions/animations (<transition> & <transition-group>)
- ❌ **Advanced** styling (basic SCSS is implemented, but the focus was on functionality)

## Project Background

📌 **This was my first Vue project**, where I focused primarily on functionality while implementing basic styling. 🎉

## 🔥 Future Improvements

Here are some possible improvements:

- 🎨 Improve styling with a more structured design (e.g., Tailwind or better SCSS organization)
- 🔄 Use Vue transitions for animated lists
- ☁️ Store todos in a backend (Firebase or Express API)
